Hall of Famer, in a rare Rookie Card depiction. Among a meager total of only 18 examples of this vintage commemorative reflected in PSA's census reporting, just two specimens have been confirmed at this tier with a mere two graded higher. This extraordinary collectible, depicting a recently activated young superstar during hockey's Golden Age, is nearly priceless in its character. The black and white, posed full-length likeness of its subject dominates the card's front, and a bilingual description appears on the reverse. The item's still-unidentified manufacturer, conjectured in recent years to have been a cigarette company, clearly took pains to deliver inserts crafted for enduring appeal. This specimen of one of the issue's key cards exhibits barely circulated character, and its corners are highly noteworthy in their strength. Shore, fondly widely known among fans and rivals as ""the meanest player in pro hockey history,"" won numerous awards and made legendary contributions to his sport. If a collection of rarities can accommodate only a sampling of hockey cards, this survivor from a mysterious series is an ideal piece to own.
