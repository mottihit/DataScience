Hall of Famer, in his coveted Rookie Card appearance. Among a total of more than 12,500 copies recorded in PSA's census reporting, fewer than one-half of 1 percent have achieved that grading service's most meritorious evaluation. Walter Payton created a singular pattern of success and sportsmanship that many others have tried to emulate. Unlike some of his competitors, however, with their more modern and better-manufactured key cards, Payton's one and only gum card rookie piece is extremely problematic in terms of condition. Even pack-fresh specimens tend to be haunted by their coarse card stock and haphazard-quality printing. This gem refused to succumb to those tendencies and is a feast for the eyes. Its centering is essentially perfect, its corners are untouched, and Payton's photograph has the highest visual fidelity imaginable. Potentially the worthy cornerstone of any Hall of Fame or Chicago Bears collection, this sparkling Payton rookie is fundamentally unimprovable. A virtually flawless rookie card of the archetypal football superstar.

Hall of Famer. Here is the undisputed key card from the foundation issue of the football collecting hobby. The 1935 National Chicle Bronko Nagurski is, by far, the single most valuable and avidly pursued of all vintage football cards. The Minnesota native and eventual Canton enshrinee starred for the Chicago Bears and was one of the earliest true superstars of his sport. His inclusion in the first meaningful gridiron card production was only natural, and he completed the legitimization of the beautiful series with his presence. Nagurski's card, number 34, emanates from the extremely scarce ""high number"" segment of the issue. This card is very difficult to obtain under any circumstances and especially so in admirable condition. The offered card is particularly noteworthy for its beautiful colors and vivid print quality. It has been spared much of the toning from age that affects so many classics from the 1930s, and it presents with enviable freshness. The corners display moderate to heavy wear from past handling, but Nagurski's image is nicely focused, and the card is quite clean, front and back. The piece's chief condition liability takes the form of a disturbance slightly above the halfway point at the left edge; the discrepancy is barely visible from the perspective of the card's back. This is an estimable example of a most desirable football card and a piece that will measurably enhance the stature of a serious collection.",1

With Staubach at the helm, the team won its final seven games and then defeated both Minnesota and San Francisco in the playoffs. In Super Bowl VI, Staubach skillfully guided the club to its first Super Bowl victory in franchise history and was also named the game's MVP. The next eight seasons were truly a testament to his talent and leadership. Six times he was selected to the Pro Bowl and he led the league in passing on four separate occasions. It can be truly stated that the Dallas dynasty, and the term ""America's Team"" were both borne through his incredible achievements on the gridiron. If anyone today needs numbers to justify his legendary reputation, they can make special note of his career passer rating of 83.4, which, at the time of his retirement, was the best mark in history by an NFL quarterback.
