Hall of Famer. This is the lone example confirmed at its stratospheric tier among a total PSA-graded population in this entry numbering nearly 1,950 copies. To regard this card with mere ""admiration"" is to under-appreciate its character. This is one of those exceptional pieces that deserves and demands passion. Many enthusiasts have never been fortunate enough to view such an important card, in such unparalleled condition. Every serious baseball card collection should include a top-quality second-year Topps card of Frank Robinson, but almost none can claim bragging rights to a Gem Mint copy. The offered card does indeed reflect superb Gem Mint condition. It is amazingly free of any of the print defects that are so common in the issue. The pioneering superstar's portrait countenance simply beams, apparently in refined Technicolor. The fantastic graphics delight the eye, and a study in opposites is presented by the intensity of the surrounding elements' hues balanced by the youthful confidence seen in the close-up portrayal. Condition attributes need no embellishment other than the restatement of the phrase ""PSA GEM MT 10."" The corners are effectively pristine, and the card's coloration and projection qualities are simply magnificent. On the reverse, a pure field of grey cardstock acts as a superb canvas for bold, vivid inking. A beyond-spectacular example of one of the great competitor's most beautiful baseball cards. Robinson, a two-time World Series Champion who managed teams and won MVP awards in both leagues, was enshrined at Cooperstown in 1982.

Hall of Famer, in his cherished Rookie Card depiction. Among a total of more than 2,500 copies of this piece recorded in PSA's census reporting, fewer than 3 percent have achieved a higher, unqualified tier. Presented is a choice example of Mickey Mantle's ""true"" rookie card. Mantle is still considered by many to be the last true baseball hero. The young outfielder accepted the torch passed by the great DiMaggio, who had similarly followed in the path of Lou Gehrig. The 1951 season was Mantle's first in pinstripes and, despite being sent back down to the minors for more seasoning, Bowman issued this card in that year's final, key series. Bowman's first vision of future greatness takes the form of this mini-artwork, rendered as a horizontal image set against the brightest skies.
In the inevitable comparison to its larger, double-printed rival, this sought-after piece is perpetually undervalued and famously condition-sensitive. And, there always seem to be fewer 1951 Bowman Mantle high number rookies available than there are of the slugger's 1952 Topps counterpart. Most significantly, the offered card is free of print lines, a defect which is typically a hallmark of the 1951 Bowman issue. This specimen is well-centered, and its central image is framed by white, apparently seldom-touched borders. The card's colors are notably bold and bright, with exceptional registration for the issue and very nicely realized flesh tones. All four aspects remain properly shaped and largely free of conspicuous wear. The item's reverse is fully legible. This card delivers a wholly satisfying measure of aesthetic appeal on the basis of its striking hues, superb focus, and, certainly, the instantly recognizable identity of its subject.

The subject's background field concedes tiny traces of superficial wear, but, overall, the piece's surface presentation remains impressive. The card's graphic elements (team logo and caption block) are unblemished. The back is unimpaired, and the corners and edges show moderate and uniformly distributed evidence of respectful circulation. Centering is inclined slightly toward the upper-right aspect. This is a very tempting and attractive piece which is ideal for the middle-grade 1952 Topps set that so many enthusiasts aspire to complete.

Both of the subjects appearing on this splendid collectible, an item that hails from its issue's perpetually difficult ""High Number"" series, have earned their shares of hobby immortality. Tom Seaver will forever be revered as one of the greatest pitchers of his time, with a career validated by rapid and overwhelmingly endorsed induction into Cooperstown's shrine. And Denehy? He shares the rookie card of Seaver, of course! The offered marvel has refused to succumb to its production's tendency toward misaligned centering, and comes equipped with a respectably sized, bright white border at each marginal aspect. These outer limits also reveal pinpoint corners, and the elements in between—the properly focused photos, the bright graphics, the lustrous gloss—are all praiseworthy in the extreme. A spectacle of a card, boasting a unique, aesthetically powerful presentation.

Hall of Famer, in his first Topps gum card appearance. Mickey Mantle's 1952 Topps card has become one of the cherished symbols of our hobby and is instantly recognized, even by non-collectors. Every fan of the vintage game covets this memento of Mickey Mantle, and no serious baseball card collection from its era can be considered complete without one. The exceptionally deep coloration of this card, especially its familiar aqua-hued background, retains an extraordinary measure of its original glamor. The slugger's bat is an almost luminescent yellow, and the white interlocking ""NY"" on the front of Mantle's cap contrasts sharply against dark navy blue. This example delivers superb centering, a crisp, gratifying aesthetic, and strong freshness of character while conceding ever-so-slight waviness in one or two of its edge cuts. This iconic depiction of the Yankee great retains much of its original power and projects phenomenal eye appeal.",81600,2

The inimitable Ty Cobb endures what was doubtless a short-lived moment of quietude on the face of this classic T206 tobacco insert card. Here, his demeanor's apparent serenity dovetails wonderfully with the card's graceful, aesthetically pure translation of his energy. On the offered example's cardfront, the likeness of the hitting legend is refined in all its aspects, and its character is enhanced splendidly by precise focus and fiery red backgrounding, the latter element blazing with a hue that reflects the fierce intensity that typified his career. It would be nearly impossible for a T206 to exhibit greater depth and clarity in printing. The card's full, snow-white borders frame Cobb's image with admirable symmetry. His penetrating gaze comes through with almost impossible strength, and his facial features are captured with a measure of precision that is rarely exhibited on entries from this era. The item's crimson background could hardly be more striking, more invigorating in its effect, and small imperfections are betrayed to the observer only at the very tips of the still well-shaped corners and in the form of a small printing disturbance above Cobb's head. The red-inked reverse proudly displays its bright, sharply calibrated print. Cobb's well-documented activities in real life were those of a warrior, but this career-contemporary artifact reveals the fire that was omnipresent even in the man's infrequent moments of calm.

Hall of Famer, in his Rookie Card appearance. An understandably coveted, much sought-after period memento, this postcard-sized showpiece is widely considered to be Lou Gehrig's Rookie Card: the item was produced for the Iron Horse's first full season with the New York Yankees. The projection of confidence inherent in the young slugger's follow-through seems prophetically complemented by the stockiness of Gehrig's frame in this arcade card's fascinating black-and-white illustration. Both attributes would serve him well during the years that followed, and it's hard to believe that, at the time this collectible's glimpse was recorded for posterity, Gehrig had only 38 career Major League at-bats to his name. The attention-grabbing souvenir's premium dimensions, along with haphazard distribution conducted only through amusement park vending machines, have ensured that the supply of this exceptionally visual memento will forever be dwarfed by the demand for it among those who revere Lou Gehrig's legacy. This superior specimen displays its famous subject (in news-photo style) in a nicely detailed image. The card concedes two tears (one horizontal tear, repaired on both obverse and reverse with tape, and one vertical tear, repaired on the reverse), natural corner rounding (including paper-loss at the top-left corner), light spots of discoloration, and a hand-written, black-ink notation on the reverse. Despite these circumstances, the blank-backed, 3-3/8-by-5-3/8-inch card's aesthetic drama and vintage mystique endure in a manner that reflects the courage and determination of the item's celebrated subject.

Robinson packed a lifetime's worth of accomplishments—including a Rookie of the Year Award, an NL MVP Award, and a World Series title in 1955—into a brief 10-season MLB career, but he will always be most revered for being the first player to break baseball's color barrier and heralding an end to racial segregation on MLB rosters. Robinson—a diamond legend and selfless civil rights activist—passed away in 1972.

""The Babe"" is displayed in a rare pitching pose on the front of this vivid, enticing piece; Ruth's desired transition from pitcher to full-time batter would be complete following his arrival in New York, as he made only five pitching appearances during his Yankees tenure (all of them wins). Cards from the W516-1 set rarely achieve a numerical PSA grading assessment due to unsightly hand-cuts; in fact, of the 107 examples of this piece recorded in PSA's census reporting, only 19 copies have received a numerical grade (including just six placed at a higher, unqualified tier). This example, featuring neat peripheral excisions, is a welcome exception to the normal state of affairs. The offered example concedes moderate evidence of past circulation to its corners and edges (with the most significant erosion exhibited near the bottom-right corner), but retains a striking, bold appearance befitting a baseball titan of Ruth's celebrity and stature.

Framed by an opulent, gold-toned border, this premium-sized, 5-1/2-by-8-3/4-inch collectible was released towards the end of Ruth's playing career; in fact, only a single season with the Boston Braves separated this card's date of issue and the legend's retirement as a player. Ruth is captured in intricate high-relief in the card's central image (one of the most immediately recognizable photographs of ""The Babe""). The cardfront concedes a series of surface wrinkles as well as mild evidence of wear to the piece's full-bleed border. The blank-backed reverse side is marked by patches of discoloration, likely as a result of one-time album adherence.

Japanese Baseball Hall of Famer. Rookie Card. Among a sparse total of just 11 copies reflected in PSA's census reporting, only two examples have achieved a higher, unqualified tier. This first-year collectible of the world's true Home Run King (a card that he shares with fellow Giants Hall of Famer Shigeo Nagashima) is impossibly scarce in any condition. Sadaharu Oh compiled 868 homers, 2,170 RBI and 1,967 runs scored (with a lifetime average of over .300), and his great career is often compared to that of the American legend, Babe Ruth. This exceptionally rare piece, intended at its time of issue more as a game card than a collectible, originates from its subjects' homeland. The dual-superstar depiction has enjoyed a fortuitous survival. The white-bordered item's coarse cardstock seems barely touched. Its corners are sharp and its unblemished colors are startlingly bright. Here's a foundation memorabilia piece—and one of the most challenging of Sadaharu Oh's rookie collectibles—honoring a pair of globally respected athletes.

To complement a new ""Win-A-Card"" trading card board game, Milton Bradley contracted with Topps to print special versions of a number of that company's 1968 baseball cards (as well as selections from Topps' Hot Rods and 1967 Football issues). The Milton Bradley baseball cards can be distinguished from their regular-issue 1968 Topps counterparts by yellow-ink reverse printing that is lighter and brighter than the dark yellow/gold ink seen in the ""standard"" gum cards. Typically, the seldom-seen ""Win-A-Card"" items (through their service as well-handled playing pieces) are subject to considerable wear. The offered card's corners, however, are robust and sharp, and its inking is terrifically bright and precise. One of the most elusive Nolan Ryan rookies in the hobby.

Hall of Famer. Rookie Card. Revered former Brooklyn Dodgers shortstop Pee Wee Reese appears on this attractive and gratifying '41 Play Ball entry that corresponds with his second season in the Major Leagues. Reese was an outstanding player in his own right: a reliable hitter, deft baserunner, and vocal team leader, he was selected to 10 All-Star teams in his career. Apart from his baseball abilities, Reese is fondly remembered for being a congenial and supportive friend to Jackie Robinson when the barrier-breaking second baseman arrived in Brooklyn in 1947; at a time when many ball players (including many of Robinson's own teammates) expressed open contempt and animosity towards baseball's first Black player, Reese worked to quell dissent within the organization and foster solidarity between Robinson, the team, and the Dodgers' faithful. The offered copy of Reese's rookie card displays the shortstop with admirable clarity and vibrancy; the card concedes grade-consistent degrees of wear to its corners, but remains a lively, charming memento from a classic baseball production.

Sandy Koufax retired in his prime and was enshrined at Cooperstown in 1972 at the age of 36, making him the youngest player ever inducted in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The offered example boasts a pleasantly bright, clear dual-portrayal of the three-time Cy Young Award winner, as well as seemingly untouched red and yellow caption blocks in the top-left corner. The card's satisfying aesthetic is only mildly affected by grade-consistent corner and edge wear (most notably along its bottom border), and remains an attractive representation of one of the most coveted 1950s Topps baseball sets.

Hall of Famer. This is one of only three examples of this piece in this configuration recorded in PSA's census reporting, each receiving the same assessment. Lefty Gomez—a two-time Triple Crown winner and five-time World Series champion—appears on this charming '41 Play Ball collectible. The item's reverse side displays the cardback of the pitcher's one-time Yankees teammate Ellsworth T. ""Babe"" Dahlgren, as opposed to Gomez's own #72 cardback, adding an additional layer of intrigue and scarcity to this piece. The card displays evidence of enthusiastic past handling in the form of edge and corner erosion, surface wrinkles, and heavy toning and discoloration on both sides. Despite these imperfections, this relic, emanating from the third and final Play Ball release, retains much of the timeless vintage appeal inherent to its production, especially in its mirthful, smiling central portrait of the great Hall of Famer.

The 1957 Topps issue was the manufacturer's first baseball release to feature full color photography, an innovation used to its full effect on Mantle's #95 entry—a bright, clear image of the icon flourishes with only yellow-and-white name, team, and position captions accompanying it on the cardfront. The depiction of a pinstriped Mantle is framed between clean white borders, and the corner aspects culminate in sharp, robust points.

A member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame's inaugural class, Ruth remains MLB's all-time leader in slugging percentage (.690), OPS (1.164), and OPS+ (206) nearly 90 years after his retirement. Ruth stars on some of baseball's most iconic collectibles, including multiple entries in Goudey's coveted 1933 issue and the ultra-scarce 1916 M101-4 Sporting News #151 ""Holy Grail."" Ruth passed away in 1948, leaving behind a legacy as a monolithic figure in baseball history.",522,2

The 1957 Topps issue was the manufacturer's first baseball release to feature full color photography, an innovation used to its full effect on Mantle's #95 entry—a bright image of the icon flourishes with only yellow-and-white name, team, and position captions accompanying it on the cardfront. The depiction of a pinstriped Mantle is framed between nicely balanced borders that culminate in corners displaying grade-consistent degrees of wear. A pair of light creases are evident near the bottom-right corner of the obverse side; the card's reverse remains pleasingly bright and clear. This is an enticing specimen of a classic Mantle depiction, displaying the outfielder at the height of his powers and the beginning of his second-consecutive MVP season. The card's grade is qualified on the basis of blue-ink marking on the upper border.",192,2

Hall of Famer. Among a total of 76 copies of this piece recorded in PSA's census reporting, only three examples have achieved a higher tier. This scarce, barely circulated collectible depicting superstar athlete Babe Ruth and popular silent film comedian Harold Lloyd emanates from a German tobacco card production that primarily featured film stars. The item's clear, black-and-white photo image introduced the dapper pair of highest-profile American celebrities to the European audience. It's speculated that the pair were together to promote Lloyd's silent film production, the 1928 feature Speedy (wherein Lloyd's character was a Yankees fan and Ruth co-starred). The historically intriguing card delivers breathtaking depth and clarity in its illustration; the piece's strongly printed reverse side and minimally touched corners contribute to its significant visual appeal.

The Giants' young star, whose determination is tellingly revealed within this item's portrayal (a depiction universally cherished within our hobby) was just beginning to demonstrate his unique talents at the time the memento was released. Very soon, however, the great player came to dominate his sport. At one time or another, he led the league in virtually every category. Mays is generally considered to have been the greatest defensive outfielder of all time, and many fans forget that when he retired, only Babe Ruth had more home runs. Had he not lost nearly two seasons to military service, Mays would no doubt have eclipsed that record. The horizontal ""rookie"" pose displayed on this collectible presents marvelously. The card's corners are commendably sharp, with barely touched character, and no wrapper stains disrupt the reverse.

Hall of Famer. Among a total of 225 examples reflected in PSA's census reporting, fewer than 12 percent have achieved a higher, unqualified tier. Following a tentative, two-year venture into the trading card industry, Berk Ross was ultimately humbled to oblivion by the overwhelming profusion of higher-quality bubblegum cards. In the company's second effort, which appeared in 1952, one of the premier images was this thrilling view of Jackie Robinson. Although revealing an attention-grabbing, unfamiliar pose, the '52 Berk Ross rendering of Robinson is nonetheless primitive, and the relatively few surviving today almost inevitably exhibit reduced condition. Conversely, when one of these cards approaching the improbable ideal anticipated by the maker does emerge, as here, it is truly an impressive sight. This very pleasing specimen's borders are mildly toned (intrinsic to the issue), but the piece is otherwise without meaningful blemish. Sharp corners and essentially faultless image registration further distinguish this scarce, beautifully preserved showpiece from the height of Robinson's career.

Hall of Famer. Here's an extraordinarily well-preserved photograph from a key 19th Century tobacco insert card featuring ""Cap"" Anson, who is widely acknowledged as the greatest ballplayer of his era. To quickly dispense with the stark reality affecting this collectible: it's really just ""the largest part of ..."" a card, as the bottom-edge portion that held ""Old Judge"" advertising has been severed and discarded. This occurred routinely, as tobacco inserts were installed in the popular Victorian-era scrapbooks, often by young ladies, and tobacco ads were considered gauche or distasteful. (And, about that: this item carries residual material consistent with one-time scrapbook mounting on its back side.) With all of that said, the stage is properly set to address the captivating piece here offered. Although Anson was included in virtually every sports-themed issue of the 1880s and 1890s, this particular depiction is universally regarded as one of his most splendid. This specimen projects a crisply resolved and attractively sepia-toned photographic image, with a notably clean surface.

Although these lifetime statistics are undeniably fantastic, most people forget that Williams lost nearly five years from the prime of his career to World War II and the Korean War (likely costing him 200 home runs and 750 RBI).

This clean entry from the esoteric '61 Nu-Card Scoops production focuses on a watershed moment in baseball history: Babe Ruth's stirring chase (and eventual capture) of his own single-season home run record in 1927. Ruth's 1927 Yankees are likely the greatest baseball lineup ever assembled: they won 110 games, pacing the next-closest AL pennant contender by a full 19 wins, and easily brushed aside the Pittsburgh Pirates in a four-game sweep in the World Series. Ruth slugged his 60th home run on Sept. 30, 1927, establishing a record that would stand, providentially, until the year of this card's release: 1961.

Hall of Famer, in an excruciatingly scarce Rookie Card appearance. This is one of only three signed copies of this piece recorded in PSA/DNA's census reporting. Legendary Cincinnati Reds catcher Johnny Bench has contributed a dramatic blue ink signature to the cardfront of this well-circulated Venezuela Topps rookie card. Printed by Topps but distributed only in the South American nation of Venezuela—where Major League Baseball has long enjoyed wide popularity—very few of these cherished examples have managed to find their way into modern collections. Virtually identical in design to a ""standard"" '68 Topps ""Reds Rookies"" gum card, the visibly coarse cardstock and subtle variations in color define this relic's true origin. The reverse side of the card concedes significant paper loss, likely as a result of its one-time adherence in a collector's album, part of the collecting tradition of its country of distribution. This is a significant, very hard-to-acquire entry, elevated in its presentation and exclusivity through the application of Bench's pronounced autograph.

Sadly, Munson's sparkling career was cut short at the age of 32 by a tragic airplane accident.

One of the greatest third basemen in MLB history, Jones' 1,623 career runs batted are the most of any player who played at the hot corner, and he is the only switch hitter in Major League history to record a .300 lifetime batting average while also hitting at least 400 home runs.

The item displays a then-18-year-old Jones in the year he was selected with the first overall pick in the 1990 MLB Draft.

An almost-never-encountered, lightly circulated Chipper Jones rookie lightly circulated Chipper Jones rookie collectible, enhanced in its presentation and prestige through the application of the star's autograph.

Hall of Famer. Presented is a colorful and charming Babe Ruth depiction emanating from the W551 multi-sport set. Collectibles from the W551 production were printed in strips of ten cards; alongside the 10 baseball players included in the issue, stars from the worlds of film (Mary Pickford, Rudolph Valentino, Charlie Chaplin), tennis (Bill Tilden, Suzanne Lenglen ), golf (Gene Sarazen), and boxing (Jack Dempsey, Pancho Villa) appeared on these mostly blank-backed, roughly 1 3/8-by-2 1/4-inch collectibles. The offered Ruth specimen emanates from his earliest days with the New York Yankees and features the famed slugger in an evocative side-profile image, surrounded by a crimson background. The piece concedes a number of creases spanning the cardfront, as well as honest corner rounding and slightly irregular edges as a result of its hand-cut nature. Ruth's serene portrayal presents clearly and boldly, retaining a significant measure of its original period charm, and remains an important early career entry of a player who defined his generation and forever changed the sport of baseball.
Babe Ruth is baseball's greatest icon; a pioneer of the home run and seven-time World Series champion. Ruth swatted home runs at an unprecedented rate—he set MLB's longstanding single-season home run record with 60 big flies in 1927—and built the New York Yankees into baseball's premier dynasty. A member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame's inaugural class, Ruth remains MLB's all-time leader in slugging percentage (.690), OPS (1.164), and OPS+ (206) nearly 90 years after his retirement. Ruth stars on some of baseball's most iconic collectibles, including multiple entries in Goudey's coveted 1933 issue and the ultra-scarce 1916 M101-4 Sporting News #151 ""Holy Grail.""
